facey is a fun and robust facial recognition application built using the [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) API.

facey functions similar to how Facebook suggests auto-tagging

Users can upload their own images and watch as facey tries to determine who your friends are! Or you can play around with the preloaded images.
